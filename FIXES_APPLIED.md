# ZyraX Bot - Critical Fixes Applied

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Commands in Help
**Problem**: Commands were showing multiple times in help output  
**Fix**: Added duplicate detection in `handlers/loader.py` using a `seen_commands` set

### 2. ✅ User Resolution for Reply Messages
**Problem**: Commands only worked when replying to messages, not with direct user specification  
**Fix**: Updated command logic to handle both reply and direct user specification properly

### 3. ✅ Time Parsing for tban Command
**Problem**: `/tban` command expected user parameter even when replying  
**Fix**: Updated `handle_tban()` to:
- Resolve user first (works with replies)
- Parse time from first arg when replying, second arg when not replying
- Extract reason from remaining args appropriately

### 4. ✅ Reason Extraction Logic
**Problem**: Reason extraction was inconsistent between reply and non-reply modes  
**Fix**: Updated both `handle_ban()` and `handle_tban()` to:
- Use all args as reason when replying
- Skip user arg when not replying

## 📋 Updated Command Behavior

### Ban Commands
```
# Direct user specification
/ban @username reason
/tban @username 1m reason

# Reply to message
/ban reason
/tban 1m reason
```

### Time Format
- ✅ `1m` - 1 minute
- ✅ `2h` - 2 hours  
- ✅ `3d` - 3 days
- ✅ `1w` - 1 week

### Help System
- ✅ No more duplicate commands
- ✅ Clean category display
- ✅ Proper command descriptions

## 🚀 Testing Results Expected

1. **Direct Commands**:
