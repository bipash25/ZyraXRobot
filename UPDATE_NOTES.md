# ZyraX Bot - Update Notes

## ✅ Fixes Applied (September 30, 2025)

### 🔧 Critical Fixes

1. **ChatMemberStatus Enum Fix**
   - ✅ Fixed `ChatMemberStatus.CREATOR` → `ChatMemberStatus.OWNER`
   - ✅ Updated in `core/helpers.py`, `handlers/admin/promote.py`, `handlers/moderation/bans.py`
   - This was causing "type object 'ChatMemberStatus' has no attribute 'CREATOR'" errors

2. **Duplicate Commands in Help**
   - ✅ Split `info.py` into separate command files
   - ✅ Created `handlers/misc/help.py` - Help command with inline keyboards
   - ✅ Created `handlers/misc/id.py` - ID command
   - ✅ Created `handlers/misc/userinfo.py` - User info command
   - ✅ Updated `handlers/misc/info.py` to only handle `/start` command

3. **MongoDB URI Parsing**
   - ✅ Fixed database name extraction from MongoDB Atlas URIs
   - ✅ Properly handles query parameters
   - ✅ Uses default `zyraX_bot` if no database name specified

4. **Handler Loader Path Resolution**
   - ✅ Fixed "not in subpath" errors
   - ✅ Added exception handling for path resolution

### 🎨 New Features

1. **Inline Keyboard Navigation for Help**
   - ✅ Added interactive button-based help system
   - ✅ Category buttons for easy navigation
   - ✅ Back button to return to main menu
   - ✅ Close button to dismiss help

2. **Better Help Organization**
   - ✅ Separate commands now load independently
   - ✅ No more duplicate entries
   - ✅ Cleaner help output

3. **Callback Query Handler**
   - ✅ Added callback handling for help navigation
   - ✅ Smooth transition between help categories
